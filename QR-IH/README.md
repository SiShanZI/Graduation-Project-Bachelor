# QR-IH
Here, treat the QR Code as a code, not an image.  
The idea is that in some cases, the capability of QR Code's error correction is useless, which you can utilize to insert private information.  
The fatal issue is that, the QR Code including its coding method is completely public. Thus, no suspect is always the matter, isn't it?  
I was a little immuture then. Â
